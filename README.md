Three basic unofficial flatpak web apps for ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. These have extremely locked down permissions, and will require adjustments via FlatSeal (or manually) to enable features like sound, microphone, and file system access (drag and drop).

To install FlatSeal for permission adjustments, run "flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal" without quotes, or find it in the Gnome Software app if applicable.

To update, run the uninstall.sh first to remove the app you're going to update, then run the install.sh. 

This is not (yet) available on Flathub. I'm still somewhat new to the Linux scene, and haven't gotten around to registering these with Gnome.
