Three basic unofficial flatpak web apps for ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. Designed to work with a copilot key in a manner reflective of the design of windows. However, the key must be mapped manually via OS settings. 

These apps have extremely locked down permissions, and will require adjustments via FlatSeal (or manually) to enable features like sound, microphone, and file system access (drag and drop).

To install FlatSeal for permission adjustments, run "flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal" without quotes, or find it in the Gnome Software app if applicable.

Scripts included for installations, removals, and updates.

This is not (yet) available on Flathub. I'm still somewhat new to the Linux scene, and haven't gotten around to registering these with Gnome.
